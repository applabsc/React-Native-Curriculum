# Project 1: Login Screen

For this project we're going to be building a login screen, which will serve as a good way to apply what we've learned about components, styling and flexbox. 

Additionally, when we start building apps in the last part of the semester, this project  might prove to be useful, as many apps will need login and account functionalities. 

The task here is to build a login screen with username/email and password fields, and a sign-in button at the very least. For inspiration for designing the login screen, look at sample screens below.

## Displaying Images

-   If you want to display images (e.g. for the logo), check out the [Image component documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/image), which has instructions on how to display local, network and base64 encoded images.
-   Also, here's the web link for Applab logo, if you would like to make Applab themed login screen: <https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/applab-sc/AppLabLogo.png>

## Getting Started
There isn't any starter code for this project, so the steps to get started are below:
* Create a new React Native project with `create-react-native-app LoginScreen` 
* `cd` into `LoginScreen` 
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Edit `App.js` to make the login screen

Additionally, linked below is a sample project which lays out an Applab themed login screen. You can refer to this if you get stuck, but do try to complete as much as possible and get help before looking at the example code.
